# Gender_Prediction_using_Handwriting

We learned various feature extraction techniques required for writer prediction through handwriting analysis. We then applied some classifiers on the feature set and also compared the performance of these classifiers with and without some image transformation techniques.

### Some of the features that are used are::
- Direction features
- Tortuosity features
- Edge based features
- Curvature features
- Chain Code Based features

Take a look at our [presentation](https://github.com/aksh98/Gender_Prediction_using_Handwriting/blob/master/IA%20presentation.pptx) to see the graphs and results.
